## Rules

- Section IDs (`P1_S1` … `P3_S3`) are **stable keys** — never rename once data has been written.
- `completion_pct` = distinct completed section IDs / 9 × 100.
- A `ProgressEvent` is recorded when a learner satisfies the **Completion Criteria** of a section.
- Content in each file is MVP shell only; full production content is out of scope for v0.
