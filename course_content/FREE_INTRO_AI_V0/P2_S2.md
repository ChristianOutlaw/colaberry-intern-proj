# P2_S2 — Exploring Data

## Summary

Introduces exploratory data analysis: reading charts, spotting trends,
and asking the right questions.

## Learning Objectives

- Read and interpret a bar chart, line chart, and scatter plot.
- Formulate one business question that a dataset could help answer.
- Identify a trend, outlier, or pattern in a simple visual.

## Outline

- What is EDA and why it comes before modeling
- Core chart types: bar (categories), line (time), scatter (relationships)
- Reading distributions: what spread and center tell you
- Spotting outliers: why they matter before training
- From chart to question: translating visuals into business insight
- Common pitfall: correlation ≠ causation

## Hands-on (optional)

*Placeholder: Learner views 3 pre-made charts and writes one observation
per chart ("I notice that…").*

## Completion Criteria

Learner completes a 3-question check. Score ≥ 2/3 triggers a `ProgressEvent`
with `section_id = "P2_S2"`.
