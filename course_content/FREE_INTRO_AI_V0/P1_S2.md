# How Machines Learn

## What you'll learn
- Understand why data is the foundation of all AI
- Walk through the training loop in plain language
- Explain how an algorithm improves over time without being told every answer

## Key ideas
- AI cannot learn without data — data is its raw material
- Learning means finding patterns, then adjusting based on feedback
- More relevant, higher-quality data leads to better predictions

## Lesson

### Data Is the Fuel

Imagine you want to teach someone to tell cats from dogs. You wouldn't write a list of rules — you'd show them thousands of photos and let them pick up the patterns naturally. That's exactly how machine learning works.

AI needs data the way a car needs fuel. Without it, nothing moves. Voice assistants learned to understand speech by processing millions of recorded conversations. Recommendation engines learned your preferences by analyzing the choices of millions of users similar to you.

> **Without data, there is no AI. There is just software with no examples to learn from.**

### The Training Loop

Here's how a machine learning model gets smarter:

1. **Input** — Feed the algorithm many labeled examples (e.g., "this email is spam," "this one isn't")
2. **Guess** — The algorithm makes predictions on new examples
3. **Feedback** — The system checks how accurate those predictions were
4. **Adjust** — The algorithm updates its internal weights to do better next time
5. **Repeat** — Thousands or millions of times

This is called **supervised learning** — the algorithm learns from labeled examples where the correct answer is already known.

Think of it like a student practicing with flashcards. Each wrong answer is information. Over enough repetitions, patterns stick.

### How Good Does It Get?

That depends on:
- **How much data you provide** — more relevant examples generally helps
- **How well the data matches reality** — training data that reflects real-world conditions matters most
- **How clean the data is** — errors and inconsistencies in training data become errors in predictions

A model trained on emails from one company will struggle to classify emails from a completely different industry. The training data shapes what the model knows — and what it doesn't.

## Common mistakes

**"AI learns on its own without human involvement."**

It doesn't. Humans define the goal, select the training data, and set up the feedback loop. The algorithm improves within a structure humans designed. An algorithm cannot discover fairness on its own — someone has to define and measure it first. AI is guided learning, not autonomous self-improvement.
