# P1_S2 — How Machines Learn

## Summary

Explains the core idea behind machine learning — finding patterns in data —
without requiring math or code.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe the difference between rule-based programming and machine learning.
- Explain what "training" a model means in plain language.
- Give one example each of supervised and unsupervised learning.

## Outline

- Rule-based vs. learned behavior: thermostat vs. spam filter
- The training loop: data in → patterns found → predictions out
- Supervised learning: labelled examples (spam/not-spam)
- Unsupervised learning: grouping similar customers
- Reinforcement learning: brief mention only (out of scope for v0)
- What can go wrong: bad data → bad predictions

## Hands-on (optional)

*Placeholder: Learner sorts 10 email subject lines into "spam / not spam" by hand,
then compares with a pre-trained filter output.*

## Completion Criteria

Learner completes a 3-question check. Score ≥ 2/3 triggers a `ProgressEvent`
with `section_id = "P1_S2"`.
