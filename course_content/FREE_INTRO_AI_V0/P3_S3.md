# Next Steps in AI

## What you'll learn
- See the realistic career paths where AI literacy creates direct value
- Understand the skill progression from conceptual understanding to hands-on work
- Know what your next concrete step looks like

## Key ideas
- Understanding AI is step one — using it and building with it require structured practice
- New roles are being created at every level of the AI and data pipeline
- Starting now is more valuable than waiting until you feel fully ready

## Lesson

### What You've Covered

In this course you built a complete picture of the AI system from end to end:

- **What AI is** — pattern recognition from data, not magic or consciousness
- **How it learns** — training loops on labeled examples, guided by human goals
- **Where data fits** — the foundation that determines everything downstream
- **Where it's used** — healthcare, business, creativity, finance, and more
- **What can go wrong** — bias, bad data, missing human oversight
- **How it's evaluated** — not just accuracy, but fairness and real-world consequences

That's the conceptual layer. The next layer is hands-on practice with real tools.

### Career Paths That Use AI Skills

You don't need to become an AI researcher. Here are realistic paths where AI literacy creates direct value:

| Role | What they do | AI connection |
|---|---|---|
| **Data Analyst** | Clean, explore, and visualize data | Prepares the data AI depends on |
| **BI Developer** | Build dashboards and reports | Translates AI outputs into human decisions |
| **ML Engineer** | Build and deploy models | Designs the systems AI runs on |
| **AI Product Manager** | Define what AI products should do | Sets the human goals AI is trained toward |
| **Domain Expert + AI** | Apply AI tools in a specific field | Uses AI to amplify existing expertise |

Every one of these paths starts with the same foundation: understanding and working with data.

### The Skill Progression

```
Conceptual understanding        ← You are here
         ↓
Working with data tools         (SQL, spreadsheets, Power BI, Python basics)
         ↓
Building and evaluating models  (ML frameworks, data pipelines)
         ↓
Specialization                  (NLP, computer vision, AI product design)
```

You don't have to climb the entire stack. Many valuable — and well-compensated — careers stop at level 2 or 3. Knowing where you want to go helps you decide how far to go.

### Your Next Concrete Step

The gap between understanding AI and using it is smaller than it looks — but you won't close it by watching more explanations. You close it by working with real tools on real data.

Colaberry's programs are designed exactly for this transition: from conceptual clarity to hands-on capability, with instructor-led support throughout. A $49 trial includes live sessions, SQL, Power BI, and a first look at AI tools — low risk, high signal on whether this path is right for you.

> **The best time to start was a year ago. The second best time is now.**

## Common mistakes

**"I'll start learning AI tools once I feel more confident."**

Confidence comes from doing, not from preparing to do. People who start experimenting now — even with small steps — are the ones who will be comfortable with whatever AI tools emerge next year. Early exposure makes adaptation faster and easier. Waiting doesn't reduce the learning curve; it just delays when you start climbing it.

## Quick check

**Q1.** What's the best next step for someone who understands AI basics and wants hands-on experience?

- A) Join a structured program to start learning real tools like SQL, Power BI, and AI ✓
- B) Try to build AI systems completely from scratch alone
- C) Wait until AI feels easier and more approachable before starting
- D) Continue watching explainer videos without any hands-on practice

**Q2.** Which foundational skill is shared by nearly all AI-adjacent career paths?

- A) Advanced calculus and linear algebra
- B) Working with data — collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing it ✓
- C) Writing fluent code in at least three programming languages
- D) Having a computer science or engineering degree

## Reflection

**What part of AI feels most exciting or valuable to you right now?**

Take a moment to write a sentence or two. There's no right answer — this is about capturing where your curiosity is pointing and what you want to do next.
