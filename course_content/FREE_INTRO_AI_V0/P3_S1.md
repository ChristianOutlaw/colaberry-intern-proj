# P3_S1 — Building Your First Model

## Summary

Guides the learner through a no-code or low-code exercise that produces
a simple predictive model.

## Learning Objectives

- Step through the basic model-building workflow end-to-end.
- Interpret a model's output (a prediction) without needing to read code.
- Distinguish between training data and new data the model has not seen.

## Outline

- Recap: data is ready (P2 output) — now what?
- Picking a goal: classification vs. regression at a conceptual level
- The workflow: load data → choose algorithm → train → predict
- No-code tools overview: AutoML, spreadsheet add-ons, drag-and-drop platforms
- Walking through one worked example (placeholder dataset)
- What the model actually produces: a score or a category
- Why the first model is rarely the best model

## Hands-on (optional)

*Placeholder: Learner uses a pre-configured no-code tool (e.g., Google Teachable
Machine or similar) to train a simple classifier and view its predictions.*

## Completion Criteria

Learner completes the exercise and submits a one-sentence description of the
prediction their model made. Submission triggers a `ProgressEvent` with
`section_id = "P3_S1"`.
