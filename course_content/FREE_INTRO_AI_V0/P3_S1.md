# Building Your First Model

## What you'll learn
- Understand what a machine learning model actually is
- Walk through a complete model-building process end to end
- Recognize the role humans play at every stage

## Key ideas
- A model is a stored set of patterns extracted from training data
- Building a model follows a predictable sequence: define → data → train → evaluate → improve
- You don't need to write code to understand — or to oversee — model development

## Lesson

### What Is a Model?

A machine learning model is a mathematical structure shaped by training data. Once trained, it stores the patterns it found — so it can apply them to new, unseen data.

Think of it as a function:

> Input data → **[Model]** → Prediction

The model doesn't think. It applies the patterns it learned during training. A model trained to detect spam applies the patterns it found in thousands of labeled spam emails to every new message it sees.

### A Simple End-to-End Example

Suppose you want to predict whether a customer will cancel their subscription in the next 30 days.

**Step 1 — Define the goal**
What exactly are you predicting? (Will this customer churn: yes or no?)

**Step 2 — Gather and prepare data**
Collect historical records: login frequency, support tickets opened, subscription length, whether each customer eventually cancelled. Clean the data thoroughly.

**Step 3 — Split the data**
Reserve some records for testing. Train on about 80% of the data; hold back the remaining 20% to evaluate performance on examples the model has never seen.

**Step 4 — Train the model**
Let the algorithm find patterns in the training set. It might learn that customers who log in fewer than twice per month and open 3+ support tickets are significantly more likely to cancel.

**Step 5 — Evaluate**
Test the model on your held-back data. How often is it right? Where does it fail? Is it missing actual churners, or flagging too many healthy customers?

**Step 6 — Improve**
Adjust which features you include, try different settings, or use a different algorithm. Retrain and re-evaluate. Repeat until performance meets the threshold needed to trust the model.

**Step 7 — Deploy with ongoing oversight**
Put the model to work — but continue monitoring it. Real-world data changes over time; models need to be updated as behavior shifts.

### The Human Role

Humans are essential at every step:
- Setting the goal (Step 1)
- Deciding what data to include and how to clean it (Step 2)
- Evaluating whether model accuracy is good enough to trust (Step 5)
- Deciding what action to take on the predictions (Step 7)

> **Building a model is a human-guided process. The algorithm finds patterns; humans decide whether those patterns are worth using.**

## Common mistakes

**"I need to fully master AI before I can start experimenting with it."**

You don't. Understanding comes from doing, not from waiting until you feel ready. You could ask an AI tool to summarize a document today — that single interaction teaches you more about how language models behave than hours of reading about them. Small experiments compound. Waiting doesn't reduce the learning curve; starting does.

## Quick check

**Q1.** What is the purpose of holding back a test set during model training?

- A) To reduce the size of the training data and make training faster
- B) To evaluate how well the model performs on examples it has never seen ✓
- C) To confuse the algorithm into generalizing better
- D) Test sets are only required for deep learning models

**Q2.** Which of the following decisions in the model-building process must be made by a human?

- A) Adjusting the internal weights of the model during training
- B) Deciding whether the model's accuracy is good enough to trust and deploy ✓
- C) Computing the loss function at each training step
- D) Selecting the random seed used to initialize the model
