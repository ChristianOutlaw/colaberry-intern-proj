# Evaluating Results

## A Model That “Works” Isn’t Always a Model You Should Trust

When someone says:

> “This model is 95% accurate.”

It sounds impressive.

But accuracy alone can hide serious problems.

Understanding how to evaluate AI systems separates surface-level excitement from real oversight.

Because a model can be mathematically impressive — and still harmful or useless.

---

## Why Accuracy Can Be Misleading

Imagine this scenario:

- 97% of all emails are legitimate
- 3% are spam

If a model classifies every email as legitimate, it will be 97% accurate.

But it will catch zero spam.

High accuracy.
Zero usefulness.

This is why evaluation requires more than a single number.

---

## The Core Metrics (Without the Math)

Here are the most common metrics teams use:

### Accuracy  
How often the model is correct overall.

Useful — but incomplete.

---

### Precision  
Of all the times the model predicted “positive,” how often was it right?

Precision matters when false alarms are costly.

Example:
Flagging too many legitimate transactions as fraud frustrates customers.

---

### Recall  
Of all the actual positive cases in the data, how many did the model successfully detect?

Recall matters when missing a case is dangerous.

Example:
Failing to detect cancer in a medical screening system can have severe consequences.

---

### F1 Score  
A balance between precision and recall.

Useful when both types of mistakes matter.

---

## Metrics Depend on Context

No metric is universally “best.”

The right metric depends on:

- The cost of a false positive
- The cost of a false negative
- The stakes of the decision
- The population affected

In spam filtering:
- A missed spam email is annoying.
- Blocking an important email may be worse.

In medical diagnosis:
- Missing a disease is often more dangerous than over-testing.

Evaluation is about consequences — not just percentages.

## Performance Is Not the Same as Fairness

Even when metrics look strong, a model may still be unfair.

AI systems inherit patterns from training data.

If the data contains historical bias, the model will learn and reproduce it.

For example:

- A hiring model trained on years of data from a company that historically hired mostly men may learn to favor male candidates.
- A facial recognition system trained mostly on lighter-skinned faces may perform poorly on darker-skinned individuals.

The algorithm is not “choosing” bias.

It is detecting patterns.

And bias is a pattern if it exists in the data.

---

## Evaluation Must Include Impact

Responsible evaluation asks questions like:

- Who is harmed when the model is wrong?
- Are certain groups affected more than others?
- Is the training data representative?
- What happens if the system fails?
- Who is accountable?

These are not technical questions alone.

They are ethical and operational questions.

And they require human judgment.

---

## The Illusion of Objectivity

AI systems can appear objective because they use math.

But math applied to biased data produces biased outcomes.

Evaluation requires:

- Technical review
- Context awareness
- Ethical reasoning
- Continuous monitoring

A model is not finished once it reaches a high score.

It must be monitored in the real world.

Because conditions change.
Behavior shifts.
Data drifts.

Trust must be maintained.

---

## Why Oversight Never Ends

Even after deployment:

- Performance can degrade
- Bias can emerge
- User behavior can change
- Data can become outdated

Responsible AI means:

- Ongoing monitoring
- Re-evaluation
- Retraining when necessary
- Transparent reporting

AI is not “set it and forget it.”

It is “build, monitor, and refine.”

---

## Why This Matters For You

If you understand model evaluation, you gain leverage.

You can:

- Question inflated performance claims
- Evaluate vendor promises
- Identify risk in automation proposals
- Ask smarter leadership questions

Understanding evaluation metrics doesn’t require advanced math.

It requires understanding trade-offs.

That’s strategic literacy.

---

## If You Remember One Thing

A high accuracy score does not guarantee a safe or trustworthy system.

Evaluation means asking:

- How does it perform?
- For whom does it perform well?
- What happens when it fails?

Responsible AI is not just about performance.

It’s about impact.
