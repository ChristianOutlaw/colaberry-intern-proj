# P2_S3 — Preparing Data for AI

## Summary

Explains data cleaning and feature selection at a conceptual level —
the steps that happen before a model is trained.

## Learning Objectives

- Name three common data cleaning steps and explain why each matters.
- Describe what a "feature" is and how feature choice affects model quality.
- Recognize when a dataset is "model-ready" vs. still needs preparation.

## Outline

- Why raw data is rarely model-ready
- Cleaning steps: handling missing values, removing duplicates, fixing formats
- Normalization and scaling: why units matter
- What is a feature: the inputs a model uses to make predictions
- Feature selection: more columns ≠ better model
- The train/test split concept (preview for P3)
- Practical heuristic: spend 80 % of AI project time on data prep

## Hands-on (optional)

*Placeholder: Learner is given a before/after dataset comparison and must
identify what was changed and why.*

## Completion Criteria

Learner completes a 3-question check. Score ≥ 2/3 triggers a `ProgressEvent`
with `section_id = "P2_S3"`.
