# P2_S1 — Understanding Data

## Summary

Covers what data is, common data types, and why data quality determines AI quality.

## Learning Objectives

- Distinguish between structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data.
- Explain why "garbage in, garbage out" is the most important AI principle.
- Identify signs of poor data quality in a sample dataset.

## Outline

- What is data: observations, measurements, records
- Structured data: tables, spreadsheets, databases
- Unstructured data: text, images, audio, video
- Semi-structured: JSON, XML, logs
- Data quality dimensions: completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness
- Real-world example: how missing values broke a loan approval model

## Hands-on (optional)

*Placeholder: Learner reviews a small CSV with intentional quality issues
(missing values, inconsistent formats) and marks the problems.*

## Completion Criteria

Learner completes a 3-question check. Score ≥ 2/3 triggers a `ProgressEvent`
with `section_id = "P2_S1"`.
