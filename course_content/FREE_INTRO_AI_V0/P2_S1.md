# Understanding Data

## What you'll learn
- Distinguish between structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data
- Explain why data quality is the single most important input to any AI system
- Recognize common signs of poor data quality

## Key ideas
- Data is just recorded observations — it has no value until you ask a question of it
- AI is only as good as the data it learned from
- Quality, diversity, and context determine whether data is useful

## Lesson

### What Data Actually Is

Data is any recorded observation: a number, a word, a photo, a timestamp, a click. It's raw. By itself it means nothing. The value comes from what you ask of it.

There are three main types:

| Type | Description | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Structured** | Organized in rows and columns | Spreadsheets, database tables, sales records |
| **Unstructured** | No fixed format | Emails, images, audio files, social media posts |
| **Semi-structured** | Partial organization | JSON, XML, server log files |

Most of the world's data is unstructured — and much of AI's recent progress has come from learning how to extract patterns from it.

### Why Data Quality Is Everything

There's a foundational rule in data work: **garbage in, garbage out**. If you train an AI on bad data, you get bad predictions — and those predictions affect real people.

Common signs of poor data quality:
- **Missing values** — some records are incomplete or blank
- **Inconsistency** — the same concept stored different ways ("Yes", "yes", "Y", "1")
- **Bias** — data that overrepresents one group and underrepresents another
- **Staleness** — data from years ago that no longer reflects current reality

> **Example:** A loan approval model trained on historical data from a period when certain groups were systematically denied credit will learn to repeat that pattern — unless the bias is identified and corrected before training.

### Data Isn't Neutral

Data reflects the world as it was when it was recorded — including its errors, its gaps, and its biases. Recognizing this is the first step in working with data responsibly.

The same dataset can tell different stories depending on what questions you ask and what you leave out. Building good AI means thinking critically about where your data came from and who it does — or doesn't — represent.

## Common mistakes

**"Data volume matters more than data quality."**

It doesn't. A massive dataset full of inconsistencies, bias, and missing values will produce a worse model than a smaller, clean, representative dataset. Quality, diversity, and context are what determine usefulness — not raw volume alone. Poor data quality is the most common reason real-world AI projects fail.

## Quick check

**Q1.** Why is data considered the "fuel" for AI?

- A) AI can think without data if the algorithm is advanced enough
- B) AI uses data to find patterns and make predictions ✓
- C) AI systems automatically correct for data quality problems
- D) Data is optional for AI — it's a nice-to-have

**Q2.** A hospital trains an AI to predict patient readmissions using records from only one city. What is the most likely problem?

- A) The model will perform perfectly everywhere
- B) The model may not generalize well to patients in different regions or demographics ✓
- C) Adding more data from the same city will always fix the problem
- D) Geography has no effect on health data
